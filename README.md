# Examination Timetabling Problem
The project, implemented in group as a final assignment for the course "Decision Making and Optimization", is an examination timetabling problem whose aim was to schedule exams assigning them to different time-slots without violating specific constraints. The project consisted in providing a linear programming formulation for the problem and developing heuristic and meta-heuristic algorithms through Java. The implemented algorithm was tested on real instances and all the results were compared with benchmark ones.
